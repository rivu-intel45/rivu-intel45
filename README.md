# Hi 👋, I’m Rivu

Curious and driven developer diving into **Machine Learning**, **Data Science**, and **Artificial Intelligence**. I enjoy turning ideas into practical projects and sharing my work so others can learn, experiment, and build with me. 
**Feel free to check out my repos for inspiration or collaboration. Star ⭐ your favorite projects if you enjoy them!**

## 🚀 What I’m Currently Learning

- Core Machine Learning concepts and building complete ML pipelines  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with **pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn**  
- Clear, insightful data visualizations and fully reproducible project documentation  
- Productive GitHub habits: structured repos, meaningful READMEs, `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt`, and version control workflow

## 🏆 Recent Projects

- **pan-card-authentication-app** – PAN card detection web app that analyzes uploaded card images, flags tampering or inconsistencies, and highlights suspicious regions using computer vision and OCR.  
- **dogbreed-deepvision** – Streamlit-based dog breed prediction app powered by deep learning; classifies uploaded dog images using a CNN trained on multiple breeds.  
- **PixelPythonSnake** – Colorful Python Turtle Snake game where you guide a growing serpent to eat food, avoid walls and its own tail, and chase high scores.  
- **building-energy-forecasting** – Jupyter Notebook project that builds ML models to forecast building energy consumption with preprocessing, training, and evaluation.  
- **house-prices-regression** – Kaggle-style house price regression with extensive EDA, feature engineering, and modelling on 1460 homes.  
- **luna-reader** – Live camera text reader with mirror mode, multilingual OCR, real-time object detection, and text-to-speech feedback using OpenCV, Tesseract, and gTTS.
